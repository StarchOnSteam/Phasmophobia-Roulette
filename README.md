A basic WPF app which rolls strategies for Phasmophobia.

You can either download the release version: https://github.com/StarchOnSteam/Phasmophobia-Roulette/releases/tag/V1.0.0
OR build the app yourself from the source code.

If you want to add strats, use the ExtraStrats.txt file, using the example within the file. If this file is in the same directory as the executable, the strats
you add here will be added to the list.

If you think your strat would be good for everyone to enjoy, write your idea in the issues tab: https://github.com/StarchOnSteam/Phasmophobia-Roulette/issues
I wont nessisarily add every idea submitted to me, and I have other work so forgive me if I dont reply to you on the same day.

Have fun :)




Phasmophobia and the Phasmophobia logo are the property of Kinetic Games, they are not my property.
